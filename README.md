Sectify: A Blockchain Voting Application


Inspiration: A more secured platform that enables transparency in the electoral process in Africa (Nigeria) integrating the Web3 technology


What it does: 

The application helps to build a formable act in credibility using an approach to select applicant. 

Sectify as a decentralized evoting platform enables users vote seamlessly without a double doubt of manipulation of results.


How we built it: 

The UIs were designed using figma, frontend was developed using next.js, smart contract used Solidity, javascript


Challenges we ran into: Integration of the Smart contract using wagmi which was later resolved.


Accomplishments that we're proud of: We were able to communicate user experience and 70% understood the importance of the product which inturn is going to be the future of credible election in the African electoral system


What we learned:

Users guide must always be considered
We need to always pursue daily prototype using the 5Ys
Developing isn't just building but seeking more communication for effective usage


What's next for SECTIFY: As a team we hope to achieve

Communicate our platform to higher authorities which has been on the line
Test our platform to lesser users like college student and local elections
Run more features like voters education, language interpretation and the disabled and veterans pattern for voting.
Explore more feedback from customers and implement relevant works
